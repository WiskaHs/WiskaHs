Well, I'm supposed to edit this file to introduce me.

I'm and old (VAX and VMS) school computer engineer, always learning and now starting a GitHub account.

Long experience in industrial computing, signal processing and automation.

Actually learning some front-end development, CSS and HTML (never too late!).

I need to update my photo profile.
